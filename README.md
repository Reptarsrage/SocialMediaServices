### An ASP.NET Core 2.0 Library

#### Description

This library contains some methods for searching and parsing comments and posts for Youtube, Google+ and Facebook using their respective API's.
Written for use in my [Best Clip Of The Week](https://github.com/Reptarsrage/bestClipOfTheWeek) web app.

#### Credits
- API's
  - [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) parses YouTube comments, and much much more.
  - [Google+ Data API](https://developers.google.com/+/api/) parses Google+ comments, and much much much more.
  - [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) parses and searches for Facebook pages, posts and comments, and much much much more.

#### TODO
- [x] Unit Tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [ ] Figute out the best parallel method (WhenAll vs Parallel.ForEach)
- [ ] Set up deployment and Nuget
- [x] Configuration utility for various api keys and secrets

#### Support
Feel free to contact me directly with any questions or concerns related to the library. I'm definitely open to criticism, ideas, suggestions and even more open to praise.
